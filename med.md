History of Medline Pathocare

Inception: The Pursuit of Precision (Est. 2025)
Medline Pathocare was founded in 2025 by Sir. Granton Trevar, a respected Medical Laboratory Officer with a vision to create a diagnostic facility focused from the simplest of the tests to complex and esoteric testing. Starting in a modest laboratory space in a Roysambu area of Nairobi, the lab initially specialized in niche endocrinology panels and routine biochemistry screening—areas where Sir. Granton Trevar felt local hospitals needed more robust, specialized support.
The early years were defined by a relentless pursuit of accuracy. Sir. Granton and his small team established rigorous quality control standards that quickly earned the trust of local Hospitals and internal medicine specialists who required reliable results for challenging cases.

Growth and Specialization (2010–2015)
As their reputation for precision grew, Medline Pathocare expanded its service offerings to include homecare services. By 2026, the lab had outgrown its original facility and moved to a state-of-the-art diagnostic center, within the same area. This expansion allowed for the introduction of molecular diagnostics, particularly in infectious disease testing and hereditary cancer screening.
During this period, Medline solidified its business model as a dedicated referral laboratory, focusing exclusively on supporting other healthcare institutions—hospitals, clinics, and smaller labs, including direct patient interaction at the facility and their homes. The focus shifted to optimizing logistics, ensuring rapid turnaround times for specialized tests across the region.

Technological Integration & Regional Reach (2016–2020)

The late 2025 saw Medline Pathocare heavily invest in automation and bioinformatics. The integration of a secure, custom-built provider portal streamlined the ordering process and result delivery, becoming a hallmark of their operational efficiency.
By 2026, Medline Pathocare served a network of over 20 clinical partners across three neighboring estates. Their success was built on a robust courier network and an expert team of laboratory scientists available for physician consultation, bridging the gap between test results and clinical application.

The Future: Indispensable Partnership (Present Day)

Today, Medline Pathocare stands as a leading referral laboratory in its area, accredited and certified by KMLTTB. The laboratory continues to expand its test menu to include cutting-edge advanced pathology services.

Medline Pathocare remains committed to its founding principles: providing the precise, actionable insights that empower fellow healthcare providers to deliver the highest standard of patient care, solidifying its role as an indispensable partner in diagnostic medicine.
